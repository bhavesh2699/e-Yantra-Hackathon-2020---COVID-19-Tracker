# e-Yantra Hackathon 2020 - COVID-19 Tracker

### Title of the Project
COVID-19 Tracker


## Description

Our idea is to provide reliable and sourced information in an analytical way to the public in real-time about COVID-19 with all the data like the number of current patients, deaths, cured and status of each state. Our Idea also contains features like chatbot where users can talk personally and can have an insight into the COVID-19. Secondly, our idea also focuses on the user live location tracking so that our app can be used to track the user coming from outside the country and living within the country. Our app will warn about the rule-breaking if user tries to cross the 10-meter radius of the current location or home location area which will be managed in real-time over the system. We have also added features like virus symptom checker and preventive measures that can be taken during this situation.

## Software Requirements
- Android Studio
- Firebase
- Google Maps API
- Google Geofence API
